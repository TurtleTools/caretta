# Neighbor joining takes as input a distance matrix specifying the distance between each pair of taxa.
# The algorithm starts with a completely unresolved tree, whose topology corresponds to that of a star network,
# and iterates over the following steps until the tree is completely resolved and all branch lengths are known:
#     1. Based on the current distance matrix calculate the matrix Q (defined below).
#     2. Find the pair of distinct taxa i and j (i.e. with i â‰  j) for which Q(i,j) has its lowest value.
#        These taxa are joined to a newly created node, which is connected to the central node
#     3. Calculate the distance from each of the taxa in the pair to this new node (branch lengths).
#     4. Calculate the distance from each of the taxa outside of this pair to the new node.
#     5. Start the algorithm again, replacing the pair of joined neighbors with the new node and using the distances calculated in the previous step.
